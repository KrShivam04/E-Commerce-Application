# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend API

A professional and scalable **Spring Boot based E-Commerce Backend** built to handle core online shopping operations such as authentication, product catalog management, cart handling, address management, and order processing.

This project solves the backend foundation required for an e-commerce platform by providing secure REST APIs, role-based access support, image handling for products, and database persistence for day-to-day commerce workflows.

## Project Overview

This backend is designed for modern e-commerce applications that need:

- Secure user authentication and authorization using **JWT**
- Product and category management for storefront operations
- Cart and order workflows for customer purchases
- Address management for delivery handling
- Admin-level APIs for maintaining catalog data
- API documentation support using **Swagger / OpenAPI**

It is suitable for backend-focused portfolios, Java full stack projects, and production-style learning implementations.
